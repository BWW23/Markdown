# How to Write a Legal Memorandum 

## Introduction: 
A legal memorandum is an in-house document used by a law firm to project the ruling of a court case. To write a memorandum (memo) you most fully understand the case going to court, and research similar cases to understand the surrounding law. These similar cases will be used to a determine whether your firm will win the case going to court.

## Theory 
A memo must objectively consider all the facts of a case, so that a law firm may make an effective legal strategy.
# Format:
## 1. Heading 
 The heading  should properly address a senior associate and reference the case being analyzed. An example heading includes:

To: Attorney [Name], Senior Associate  
From: [Your Name], Junior Associate 
Date: 
Re: [Case Name]



## 2. Question Presented 
In this section, state the question(s) which the court will determine about your case. For example: 

1. Will a court determine that *John Doe* was liable for the protection of *Jane Doe*?
2. Will a court determine that *Officer Bob* created a special relationship with *Jane Doe*, and thus was liable for the health and safety of *Jane Doe*?

## 3. Brief Answer 
Provide a brief answer to the question(s) asked in the section above. Write a brief answer for every question presented. 
A brief answer should include: 
- Reference to the court's expected decision 
- The question presented 
- One sentence describing how the court reached its decision

## 4. Factual Summary 
Write this section as a story, summarizing  the events leading to and following the incident. Include all details relevant to the case. 
Make sure to:
- Include the date of the incident 
- Include the names and roles of those involved in the incident 
- Follow chronological order 
 
## 5. Discussion 
 For each question presented, analyze several similar cases to gain an understanding of the relevant common law. 
Determine:
- How does your case compare to similar cases
- How does your case differ from similar cases
- What will the court *likely* determine

## 6. Conclusion 
Write a separate  conclusion for each of the questions presented. 
Within each conclusion include: 
- The expected findings of the court 
- How these findings relate to the question presented 

## 7. Signature
Include a signature at the end of the memo.
For example: 

Respectfully Submitted,
[Your Name] 

## 8. Important Notes
- Clearly label the start of each section (except for the heading and signature)
- For each question presented write a brief answer, discussion, and conclusion
- Number each question presented; number each brief answer, discussion, and conclusion with their associated question presented.
